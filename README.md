# bookstr

This repository contains a small React + TypeScript playground implementing
a few pieces of the **Bookstr PWA UI Specification**. It uses Tailwind CSS
with design tokens defined in `src/designTokens.css`.

Currently the project only provides a minimal `AppShell`, a `Header`, a
`BottomNav`, and other basic components. The layout and theming follow the
specification but functionality is limited.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run a development server with your preferred tooling (e.g. Vite or
   another bundler) pointing to `src/main.tsx` as the entry.

This repository does not yet include a fully configured build system; it is
just the beginning of an implementation.
